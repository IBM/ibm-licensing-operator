# Enabling optional features

You can enable the optional features of License Service to get extra benefits.

Available features:

- **Chargeback: Filtering the license usage data by user-defined groups** - Use this feature to filter the license usage data by groups that are based on namespaces. Thanks to grouping, you can see how the internal organizations or business divisions in your company contribute to the overall license usage. This information might also help you monitor the namespaces during migrating your software to Cloud, or with establishing the potential chargeback.
- **Enabling hyperthreading** - Use this feature to enable License Service to properly count your license usage on the clusters where Simultaneous multithreading (SMT) or Hyper-Threading (HT) are enabled. When you enable hyperthreading, your license usage on clusters with SMT or HT are aggregated with regard to the hyperthreading rules.

Top learn more about these features and hot to configure them, see [Enabling optional features](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cpfs?topic=operator-enabling-optional-features).
