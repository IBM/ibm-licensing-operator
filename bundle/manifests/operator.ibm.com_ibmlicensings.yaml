          IBMLicensing custom resource is used to create an instance of the License Service, used to collect information about license usage of IBM containerized products and IBM Cloud Paks per cluster.
          You can retrieve license usage data through a dedicated API call and generate an audit snapshot on demand.
          Documentation: For additional details regarding install parameters check: https://ibm.biz/icpfs39install.
          License: Please refer to the IBM Terms website (ibm.biz/lsvc-lic)
          to find the license terms for the particular IBM product for which you are deploying this component.

                        The phase of a Pod is a simple, high-level summary of where the Pod is in its lifecycle.
                        The conditions array, the reason and message fields, and the individual container status
                        arrays contain more detail about the pod's status.
                        There are five possible phase values:

                        Pending: The pod has been accepted by the Kubernetes system, but one or more of the
                        container images has not been created. This includes time before being scheduled as
                        well as time spent downloading images over the network, which could take a while.
                        Running: The pod has been bound to a node, and all of the containers have been created.
                        At least one container is still running, or is in the process of starting or restarting.
                        Succeeded: All containers in the pod have terminated in success, and will not be restarted.
                        Failed: All containers in the pod have terminated, and at least one container has
                        terminated in failure. The container either exited with non-zero status or was terminated
                        by the system.
                        Unknown: For some reason the state of the pod could not be obtained, typically due to an
                        error in communicating with the host of the pod.
