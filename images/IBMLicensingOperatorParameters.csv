Parameter,What kind of value expected,Default Value,Required,Description
imageRegistry,text,quay.io/opencloudio,no,Registry from where to pull IBM Licensing Service application
imageName,text,Ibm-licensing,no,Docker image name for IBM Licensing Service application
imageTagPostfix,text,1.0.0,no,IBM Licensing Service docker image tag
apiSecretToken,text,ibm-licensing-token,no,Secret name used to store application secret token. Either one that exists or one that will be generated by operator. The namespace from `instanceNamespace` parameter’s value will be used.
datasource,metering or datacollector,metering,yes,How should data be collected. By default custom resource will propose `metering` value that means the application will use IBM Metering Service. When using IBM Licensing Service without Common Services you should use datacollector option instead as metering is unavailable then.
httpsEnable,true or false,true,yes,Enables https access at pod level. When enabled you need to choose its source at parameter httpsCertsSource
httpsCertsSource,self-signed or custom,self-signed,no,If https is enabled (as it should be) you can either use `self-signed` certificate from inside pod or when you set `custom` value you can use your certificate as kubernetes secret that you need to create in namespace `instanceNamespace` with name `ibm-licensing-certs`
logLevel,INFO or DEBUG,INFO,no,Should application pod show additional information
instanceNamespace,text,ibm-common-services,yes,Namespace that exists or that should be created where IBM Licensing Operator resources will exist. In case metering data collection is used it should be the same as IBM Metering Service’s resources namespace. (if installing in a some bundle together default value should be correct)
securityContext,structure,,no,In some clusters additional securityContext options needs to be provided. You can set this structure in that case. The values will be added to deployment.
- runAsUser,integer,,yes if setting securityContext parameter,Specifies that for IBM Licensing Service pod all processes run with that user ID
imagePullSecrets,list of texts,,no,Array of pull secrets that should exist at `instanceNamespace` to allow pulling IBM Licensing Service image from `imageRegistry` set in different parameter
routeEnabled,true or false,true only if supported,no,Should Route be created to expose IBM Licensing Service API? (only if Route is supported on your cluster)
ingressEnabled,true or false,true only if Route not supported,no,Should Ingress be created to expose IBM Licensing Service API?
routeOptions,structure,,no,If route is enabled you can set its parameters
- TLS,structure,,no,More information on Route documentation here: https://godoc.org/github.com/openshift/api/route/v1#TLSConfig
ingressOptions,structure,,no,If ingress is enabled you can set its parameters
- Path,text,,no,Path after host where API will be available f.e. if set to ibm-licensing-service-instance then API will be available at https://<hostname>:<port>/ibm-licensing-service-instance
- Annotations,list of texts,,no,List of ingress annotations that can include some needed key value pairs such as kubernetes.io/ingress.class:nginx or rewrite-target:/
- TLS,structure,,no,More information on Ingress documentation here: https://godoc.org/k8s.io/api/extensions/v1beta1#IngressTLS
- Host,text,,no,Host where API will be available f.e. if set to my-host.ibm.com then API will be available at https://my-host.ibm.com:<port>/<path>
