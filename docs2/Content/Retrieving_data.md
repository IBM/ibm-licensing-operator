# Retrieving license usage data from the cluster

## Available APIs

License Service collects and measures information about license usage of your IBM containerized software.

You can use a set of dedicated APIs to retrieve the following information:
- Retrieving an audit snapshot for the cluster
- Retrieving license usage of products on a cluster level
- Retrieving license usage of bundled products on the cluster level
- Retrieving information about License Service version
- Retrieving information about License Service health

For detailed information about License Service APIs, see [APIs for retrieving License Service data in IBM Knowledge Center](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSHKN6/license-service/1.x.x/retrieving.html).

## Tracking license usage in multicluster environment

You can use the data that is collected by License Service from individual clusters to track the cumulative license usage in a multicluster environment. The cumulative report is not required for audit, but it might give you a full overview of your license usage in the multicluster environment.

You can use the non-automated procedure to create a cumulative report for your environment. For more information, see [Manually tracking license usage in multicluster environment in IBM Knowledge Center](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSHKN6/license-service/1.x.x/multicluster.html).
